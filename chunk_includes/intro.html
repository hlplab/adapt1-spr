In order to match your results with your Mechanical Turk account (so we can approve your work) the next page will ask for your Worker ID. If you don't know it, please go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/dashboard">Mech Turk dashboard</a> (link should open in a new window) and copy it to your clipboard now.

<p>At the end of the experiment, you will be given a code. Please copy the code and paste it into the form on the HIT on Mechanical Turk so we can verify that you've done the experiment.</p>
